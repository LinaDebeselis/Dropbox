  • On the create user form, the user can tap the back button to go to the page where they can sign in or create an account.
  • Before creating the account, user can choose to read the terms of service.
  • After creating the account, user can view the placeholders for Files, Photos, and Favorites as well as the Settings screen.

Optionals:
